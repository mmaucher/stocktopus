# Stocktopus

This project will start as a collection of modules that collect data about stocks (and other assets) and grow from there.

## ToDo list (somehow in order of priority)
- Functions for getting the next start/stop dates (and times) of some common investment/trading strategies based on seasonalities
- Function to print a calender-like list of the next dates and times for the strategies mentioned
- Access to a PostgreSQL database
- Functions to retrieve stock courses of some stocks and ETFs
- Functions to create variants of Meb Faber's IVY portfolio
